Burning Tree 
Given a binary tree, return the list of keys of each node in the tree as it is burning. 
 Example 
 Given a binary tree: 
   1 
  / \ 
 2   3   4 
    / \ 
   5   6
return [[1],[2,3,4],[5,6]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 burns from top to bottom, so the second list is [2,3,4].
5 and 6 burns from right to left, so the third list is [5,6].
