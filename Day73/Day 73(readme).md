Question:- Sum of elements between k1'th and k2'th smallest elements
Given an array arr[] and two numbers k1 and k2 where k1 is smaller than k2, the task is to find sum of all elements from k1’th smallest to k2’th smallest element.

Examples 1:

Input : arr[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14}, k1 = 3, k2 = 6
Output : 26
The 3rd smallest element is 10 and 6th smallest element is 20.
Sum of elements between k1 and k2 is 10 + 12 + 14 + 20 = 26.

Example 2:
Input : arr[] = {10, 2, 50, 12, 48, 13, 5}, k1 = 2, k2 = 5

Output : 65
The 2nd smallest element is 5 and 5th smallest element is 48.
Sum of elements between k1 and k2 is 10 + 12 + 13 + 48 = 65.
