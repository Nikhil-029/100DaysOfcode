Maximum sum of non adjacent nodes in a tree
Given a binary tree, find the maximum sum of non adjacent nodes in a tree.
Example 1:
For the following binary tree:
  1
 / \
2   3
The maximum sum is 4 (1 + 3)
Example 2:
For the following binary tree:
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
The maximum sum is 9 (4 + 5)
