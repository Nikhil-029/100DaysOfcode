Ques: Sum of the longest bloodline of a tree
Desc: Given a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum sum of all the nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node. If two or more paths compete for the longest path, then the path having maximum sum of nodes is being considered.
Example:
Input : 
        4
      /   \
     2     5
    / \     \
   7   1     3
Output : 13
Explanation : The maximum sum path is 4 + 5 + 3 = 12.
Example 2:
Input : 
        -15
      /    \
     5      6
    / \    / \
   -8  1  3   9
  /  / \    /  \
 2  6   2  0    4
Output : 0
Explanation : Longest sum path is -15 + 6 + 9 = 0.
