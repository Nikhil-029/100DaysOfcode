Topic:- Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm  

1). Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

2). The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

3). Dijkstra's algorithm is very similar to Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. The main difference is that Prim's algorithm builds a tree by adding edges one by one to an initially empty spanning tree, whereas Dijkstra's algorithm builds a tree by adding nodes one by one to an initially empty tree, and at each step finds the cheapest path between the new node and the nodes in the tree.

4). Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, but it is also useful as a subroutine in other graph algorithms. For example, it can find the shortest paths from a single node to all other nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in O(V+E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. It can also be used to find the shortest paths from a single node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, provided that all edge weights are non-negative.

5). Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm. In each step, it selects the unvisited node that is closest to the source, and calculates the distance to all its neighbors. It terminates when the target node has been visited; the path can be reconstructed from the predecessor list.
