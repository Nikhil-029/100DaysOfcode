Question:- Detect cycle in an undirected graph
Given an undirected graph, how to check if there is a cycle in the graph?

Example:

Input: n = 4, e = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->1
These edges form a cycle in the graph.


Input: n = 3, e = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 1->2, 2->3, 3->1
These edges do not form a cycle in the graph.
