reverse First k elements of Queue :

Given an integer k and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.
Test Cases:
Input :
queue = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
k = 5
Output :
queue = [50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
Input :
queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
k = 3
Output :
queue = [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
