Ques:- Merge two BST's


Given two BST, your task is to complete the function merge which returns a pointer to the root of the new BST formed by merging the two given BST's. In other words, merge function should return a pointer to the root of the BST formed by merging two BST's given as arguments.
Note: You are required to complete the function merge only and not the entire program.
Input:
The function takes 2 arguments as input, the reference pointer to the root of the first BST(root1) and the reference pointer to the root of the second BST(root2).
There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately.
Output:
For each test case output in a single line the inorder traversal of the new BST formed by merging the two BST's.
