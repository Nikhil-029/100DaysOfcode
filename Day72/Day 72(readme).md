Question: -k largest elements 
Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 7, k = 3
7 10 4 3 20 15
Output: second largest= 15, largest element = 20.
