Queue using two stacks
Description
Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.
Example
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
queue.dequeue() # returns 1
queue.dequeue() # returns 2
queue.dequeue() # returns 3
