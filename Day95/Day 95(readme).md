Question: -Unique rows in boolean matrix

Description:-

Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1.

Example:-

Input: mat[M][N] = {{1, 0, 0, 1},
                    {0, 0, 1, 0},
                    {0, 0, 0, 0}};
Output: mat[M][N] =  {{1, 1, 1, 1},
                      {1, 0, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1}};
Explanation: The modified matrix represents
the value of each cell in its row and column
as 1.
