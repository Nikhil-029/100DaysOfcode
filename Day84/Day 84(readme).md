Question: = Minimum Swaps to Sort

Given an array of n distinct elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in strictly increasing order.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 3 2 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: Swap index 0 with 3 and 1 with 2 to
form the sorted array {1,2,3,4}.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
