Question:- 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem

Problem Statement

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Example

Input: val[] = {60, 100, 120}, wt[] = {10, 20, 30}, W = 50 Output: 220 Explanation: There are 3 items to choose from. A DP table is constructed such that dp[i][j] stores the maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to j with first i items considered. The maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to 50 with first 3 items considered is 220 (120 + 100)
